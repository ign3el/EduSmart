# MEMORY BANK SYSTEM
- I use a Memory Bank in the `/memory-bank` directory to preserve knowledge.
- **Initialization**: If this directory is missing, ask me to "initialize memory bank" immediately.
- **Required Files**: Maintain `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- **Start-of-Task**: Read ALL memory bank files before performing any action. Do not ask me what the project is about; it is in the bank.
- **End-of-Task**: Update the bank files (especially `activeContext.md` and `progress.md`) before finishing.
